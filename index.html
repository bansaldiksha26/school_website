<p> Mr. Amit Jain: The one lesson that I have learnt in the profession of teaching is that the only way to make a student trustworthy is to trust him and the surest way to make him untrustworthy is to distrust and show your mistrust. We surely have the power to call out the best or the worst in a student by our own expectations. Treat a student as he/she appears to be and you make him worse. But treat a student as if he/she already were what he potentially could be, and you make him/her what he/she should be. Most of the students who come under our influence have within them, a mixture of good and bad, ambition and lassitude, strengths and weakness. We can choose whether to build on their strengths or to get obsessed with their weaknesses. Every child is born unique & hence they need the right ambience to unlock their potential to the fullest . The teaching methods at VPSS-17 encourage kids to innovate & take risks when developing new ideas & considering solutions to problems . While the pursuit of academic excellence and the fostering of a lifelong love of learning are the foundation of VPSS-17 , our commitment extends beyond scholastic achievement to strike a balance in the lives of our students. Outstanding extracurricular activities provide students with an enriching experience. Students are given the opportunity to pursue their talents via excellent fine arts and music programs as well as participating in a variety of athletic activities. At VPSS-17, students embark on a journey of knowledge that encourages them to learn about themselves and the world in which they live. Within a warm and nurturing atmosphere, they develop strong bonds with their teachers and are encouraged to participate, take risks, become confident and most of all, become contributing members of the society. We create a milieu in which the youth can flourish while acquiring a deep sense of self-esteem.</p></div>
